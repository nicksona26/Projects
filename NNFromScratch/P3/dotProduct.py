# what is shape in numpy?
    # shape gives the size at each dimension of an array

# 2D array example
list = [[2,3,4,5],[3,2,6,9]]
#shape would return (2,4)
list2 = [[[2,3,4,5],[3,2,6,9]],[[2,3,4,5],[3,2,6,9]],[[2,3,4,5],[3,2,6,9]]]
#shape would return 3, 2, 4

# what is a tensor?
    # object that can be represented as an array



# dot product example
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [2, 3, 4]

dotProduct = a[0]*b[0] + a[1]*b[1] + a[2]*b[2]
